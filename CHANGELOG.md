## [0.1.13.0] - 2025-05-11

### Added
- **Preprocessor:** Implemented `معرف` as the Arabic equivalent for the `defined` operator in conditional expressions. (File affected: `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_expr_eval.c`).
- **Preprocessor:** Implemented macro expansion rescanning. The preprocessor now correctly rescans the output of a macro expansion for further macro names to be replaced, adhering more closely to C99 standards. This includes handling nested expansions and using the macro expansion stack to prevent direct recursion during the rescan of a macro's own output. (Files affected: `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_line_processing.c`).
- **Preprocessor:** Corrected `__السطر__` (`__LINE__`) predefined macro to expand to an integer constant as per C standard, instead of a string literal. (File affected: `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_line_processing.c`).
- **Preprocessor:** Implemented C99-style Variadic Macros using Arabic syntax: `وسائط_إضافية` (for `...`) in parameter lists and `__وسائط_متغيرة__` (for `__VA_ARGS__`) in macro bodies. This includes parsing, argument collection, and substitution logic. (Files affected: `include/baa/preprocessor/preprocessor.h`, `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_macros.c`, `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_directives.c`, `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_expansion.c`, `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_line_processing.c`, `src/preprocessor/preprocessor.c`).
- **Testing:** Added comprehensive test cases for `معرف` operator, `#الغاء_تعريف` directive, various complex macro rescanning scenarios, and variadic macros to `tests/resources/preprocessor_test_cases/consolidated_preprocessor_test.baa`.

### Changed
- **Documentation:** Extensive updates across `docs/language.md`, `docs/c_comparison.md`, `docs/arabic_support.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `README.md`, `docs/PREPROCESSOR_ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/LEXER_ROADMAP.md` to:
    - Finalize and document Arabic keywords for: `معرف` (for `defined`), `__إصدار_المعيار_باء__` (for Baa version), `__الدالة__` (for `__func__`), variadic macros (`وسائط_إضافية`, `__وسائط_متغيرة__`), other standard directives (`#خطأ`, `#تحذير`, `#سطر`, `أمر_براغما`, `#براغما`), `تعداد` (for `enum`), `لكل` (for C-style `for` loop).
    - Finalize and document Arabic syntax for: float exponent marker (`أ`), literal suffixes (`غ`, `ط`, `طط`, `ح`), and escape sequences (using `\` + Arabic letter).
    - Clarify struct/union member access (`::` for direct, `->` for pointer).
    - Remove `دالة` as a function declaration keyword and update examples to C-style.
    - Ensure consistency in logical operator representation (symbols `&&, ||, !` used in syntax).
    - General alignment of C99 features and their Baa equivalents, including keywords like `مستقر`, `خارجي`, `مضمن`, `مقيد`, `متطاير`, `نوع_مستخدم`, `حجم` and type `عدد_صحيح_طويل_جدا`.
- **Tests:** Updated `tests/resources/preprocessor_test_cases/consolidated_preprocessor_test.baa` to use `معرف` instead of `defined`.

### Fixed
- **Preprocessor Build:** Resolved various compiler errors (including "undeclared function" and "lvalue" issues) in `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_line_processing.c` related to the rescanning implementation through code refactoring and build cleaning.

### Known Issues
- **Preprocessor:** Token pasting (`##`) during the rescanning phase (i.e., when `##` appears in the output of a previous expansion, not in an original macro body) is not fully correctly handled. Operands of `##` that are macro names might be expanded prematurely before pasting, or the `##` operator itself might be treated literally. This is a known limitation of the current rescanning implementation.

## [0.1.12.0] - 2025-05-09

### Major Refactoring
- **Core Components:** Removed old AST and Parser components to facilitate a fresh start and redesign. (Commit: `454a715`)

### Added
- **Preprocessor:** Implemented support for bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) in conditional compilation expressions (`#إذا`, `#وإلا_إذا`).

### Changed
- **Lexer:**
  - Consolidated the internal `keywords` array definition to `src/lexer/lexer.c`, making it globally accessible via `extern` declaration in `include/baa/lexer/lexer_internal.h`. This removes duplication from `src/lexer/token_scanners.c`.
  - The size of the keywords array (`NUM_KEYWORDS`) is now also globally available via `extern const size_t`.
  - Ensured user-facing lexer error messages are in Arabic.
- **Documentation:**
  - Updated `docs/lexer.md`: Removed outdated "Implement documentation comments" from "Future Improvements" as it's already implemented.
  - Updated `docs/preprocessor.md`:
    - Clarified initial statement on file encoding to reflect auto-detection (UTF-8 default, UTF-16LE).
    - Updated "Input Abstraction" in "Future Enhancements" to note current file/string support and `stdin` as future.
  - Updated `docs/PREPROCESSOR_ROADMAP.md`:
    - Reflected current status of file encoding and input abstraction.
    - Made "macro rescanning" and `#if` macro evaluation items more explicit.
    - Added "Other Standard Directives" (`#error`, `#warning`, `#line`, `#pragma`) as future work.
    - Added "Improve error recovery mechanisms" to implementation priorities.
- **Preprocessor Refactoring:**
  - Split `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_core.c` into:
    - `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_directives.c`: Handles directive logic (lines starting with `#`).
    - `src/preprocessor/preprocessor_line_processing.c`: Handles macro substitution for non-directive lines.
  - `preprocessor_core.c` now delegates to functions in these new files.
  - Updated `CMakeLists.txt` (root and `src/preprocessor/`) to include the new source files.
- **Build System:** Updated project version in root `CMakeLists.txt` to 0.1.12.0.
- **Testing:** Consolidated individual preprocessor test files from `tests/resources/preprocessor_test_cases/` into a single file `tests/resources/preprocessor_test_cases/consolidated_preprocessor_test.baa`. The original files were removed after successful testing of the consolidated file.

### Fixed
- **Build:** Resolved redefinition error for `struct KeywordMapping` by ensuring its definition resides only in `include/baa/lexer/lexer_internal.h`.
- **Preprocessor:**
  - Corrected handling of comments within `#elif` directive expressions.
  - Added stripping of trailing comments from `#define` macro bodies to prevent them from being part of the macro definition.
  - Fixed a crash related to `handle_preprocessor_directive` by ensuring a valid pointer was passed for the `is_conditional_directive` output parameter.
- **Build:**
  - Resolved various build errors related to the preprocessor refactoring and parser function visibility/definitions.
  - Addressed "undefined symbol" errors for `handle_preprocessor_directive` and `process_code_line_for_macros` by correctly adding new preprocessor files to executable targets.
  - Fixed "duplicate symbol" and "undeclared function" errors for `is_type_token` by:
    - Removing the duplicate definition from `src/parser/parser_helper.c` and its declaration from `include/baa/parser/parser_helper.h`.
    - Making the existing definition in `src/parser/parser.c` non-static.
    - Adding the declaration of `is_type_token` to `include/baa/parser/parser.h`.
    - Ensuring `src/parser/parser.c` includes `baa/parser/tokens.h` for visibility of `TOKEN_*` enum values.
  - Corrected `is_type_token` implementation in `src/parser/parser.c` to use the correct `BaaTokenType` members (e.g., `BAA_TOKEN_TYPE_INT`) instead of `TokenType` members, resolving enum comparison warnings.
  - Temporarily stubbed parser functions (`baa_parse_function_rest`, `baa_parse_variable_rest`, `baa_parse_import_directive`) in `src/parser/declaration_parser.c` to resolve "undefined symbol" linker errors and allow the project to build for preprocessor testing. These stubs are temporary, and the underlying parser logic for these declaration types will require further attention.

### Deprecated
- The `[0.1.11.0] - 2025-05-08` entry below is now superseded by this entry due to further changes and a more accurate date. Consider removing or merging.

## [0.1.11.0] - 2025-05-08 (Superseded)

### Added
- **Preprocessor:** Added Input Source Abstraction, allowing `baa_preprocess` to accept input from files (`BAA_PP_SOURCE_FILE`) or directly from wide character strings (`BAA_PP_SOURCE_STRING`) via the new `BaaPpSource` struct.
- **Preprocessor:** Added Input Source Abstraction, allowing `baa_preprocess` to accept input from files (`BAA_PP_SOURCE_FILE`) or directly from wide character strings (`BAA_PP_SOURCE_STRING`) via the new `BaaPpSource` struct.
- **Preprocessor:** Added support for reading UTF-8 encoded input files (with or without BOM), in addition to UTF-16LE. Encoding is auto-detected.
- **Lexer:** Added support for documentation comments (`/** ... */`), tokenized as `BAA_TOKEN_DOC_COMMENT`.
- **Lexer:** Added support for multiline string literals (`"""..."""`). (Commit: 9b4b8a0)
- **Lexer:** Added support for raw string literals (`خ"..."` and `خ"""..."""`), including single-line newline error handling. (Commit: 5caef53)

### Fixed
- **Compiler:** Fixed use-after-free bug and potential infinite loop in lexer token processing loop (`compiler.c`) by refactoring to a standard `for` loop, ensuring correct termination on EOF or ERROR tokens. (Commit: d08a915)
- **Lexer:** Corrected handling of single-line raw strings (`خ"..."`) to properly report an error if a newline is encountered before the closing quote. (Commit: 5caef53)

### Changed
- **Lexer:** Improved error reporting for multiline strings by tracking start line/column. (Commit: 9b4b8a0)


## [0.1.10.0] - 2025-05-07

### Changed

- **Lexer Enhancements & Fixes:**
  - **Numeric Literal Tokenization:**
    - Correctly tokenizes Arabic-Indic digits (٠-٩ / U+0660-U+0669) as part of integer and float literals.
    - Implemented support for binary (`0b`/`0B`) and hexadecimal (`0x`/`0X`) integer prefixes.
    - Added support for underscores (`_`) as separators in all valid positions within numeric literals (integers, floats, including prefixed numbers and exponent parts).
    - Recognizes the Arabic decimal separator (`٫`, U+066B) as a valid decimal point in float literals. (Note: Console display of `٫` in lexemes might appear as `?` due to terminal limitations, but internal processing is correct).
  - **Dispatch Logic:** Refined character type dispatch in `baa_lexer_next_token` to correctly prioritize digit types (Arabic-Indic, then Western) before general identifier characters, resolving misidentification of Arabic-Indic digits as identifiers.
  - **Error Messaging:** Clarified the error message for invalid escape sequences (e.g., `\'`) within string literals.
  - **Modularization:** Further modularized the lexer by moving token scanning logic (`scan_identifier`, `scan_number`, `scan_string`, `scan_char_literal`) into `src/lexer/token_scanners.c` and character utilities into `src/lexer/lexer_char_utils.c`. Introduced `src/lexer/lexer_internal.h` for internal declarations. (This completes earlier modularization efforts and resolves associated build issues).
- **Documentation:**
  - Significantly updated `docs/lexer.md` to reflect the current capabilities regarding numeric literal parsing, Arabic language support, and overall lexer functionality.

### Added

- **Testing:**
  - Created a new comprehensive lexer test suite: `tests/resources/lexer_test_cases/lexer_test_suite.baa` to cover a wide range of lexer features and edge cases.

## [0.1.9.9] - 2025-05-06

### Added

- Standalone preprocessor tester executable (`tools/baa_preprocessor_tester.c`) for isolated testing.
- Placeholder implementations for missing parser functions (`baa_parse_if_statement`, `baa_parse_while_statement`, `baa_parse_for_statement`, `baa_parse_return_statement`, `baa_create_compound_assignment_expr`, `baa_create_grouping_expr`) to allow the build to complete.
- Added Arabic predefined macros to the preprocessor:
  - `__الملف__` (equivalent to `__FILE__`)
  - `__السطر__` (equivalent to `__LINE__`)
  - `__التاريخ__` (equivalent to `__DATE__`)
  - `__الوقت__` (equivalent to `__TIME__`)
- Unified preprocessor error reporting to consistently use original source location (file, line, column) for all errors.

### Fixed

- Preprocessor: Fixed bug where `#إذا` directives using macros defined as simple integers (e.g., `#تعريف DEBUG 1`) were not evaluated correctly, causing the enclosed block to be skipped erroneously. The expression evaluator now handles this case.
- Build: Corrected mismatch between `baa_parse` and `baa_parse_program` definitions/declarations in `src/parser/parser.c`.
- Build: Added missing declaration for `baa_parse_for_statement` in `include/baa/parser/parser.h`.

### Changed

- **Parser Refactoring:** Split `src/parser/parser.c` into more modular components:
  - `src/parser/parser_helper.c`: Contains core utilities like `advance`, `peek`, `match_keyword`, error helpers, etc.
  - `src/parser/statement_parser.c`: Contains statement dispatching (`baa_parse_statement`) and block parsing (`baa_parse_block`).
  - `src/parser/declaration_parser.c`: Contains declaration dispatching (`baa_parse_declaration`) and import parsing (`baa_parse_import_directive`).
- **Code Synchronization:** Aligned parser implementation files and `docs/PARSER.md` documentation. Corrected public API documentation, added missing documentation for imports, resolved conflicting function definitions.

### Fixed

- **Build Errors:**
  - Resolved duplicate symbol linker errors by consolidating function implementations (error handling, parser helpers) and removing `src/parser/error_handling.c`.
  - Fixed math library linking error (`m.lib`) on Windows/Clang by adding `m` to `target_link_libraries` in the root `CMakeLists.txt`.
